Welcome to the final installment of the UTA 100 2019 series. The previous two posts covered general runner performances and runner interactions throughout the course, respectively. It is now time to zoom in on a select number of individuals.  

This post is dedicated to understanding how the top 10 runners trained during the lead up to the event. Hopefully we can all learn something that can be taken away and implemented into our own training plans, as-is or slightly modified.

There will be some suprises.

## Individual training approaches

[Strava][strava] is a popular fitness app used for storing training sessions. In addition to keeping track of each session, Strava shows weekly and yearly statistics that helps athletes oversee their progression within any training block.

The training data for the top 10 athletes who had Strava accounts was used to create the graphs, and analysis that follows. Before proceeding an important statement needs to be made:

**Unless otherwise stated: the rolling-mean of any given quantity is used to create a graph rather than the actual values.**

Here's the justification: A rolling-mean smooths over fine-scale variations in the data thus enabling larger-scale trends to become more apparent. No single session is the key to a successful performance. Rather it is the compilation and sequencing of many sessions together, each of which builds upon the ground left by the previous session. The use of a rolling-mean is the mathematical embodiment of this idea. 

There is however one parameter that is needed to be supplied a priori for any rolling-mean calculation: how many values to include when computing the rolling-mean for any given point, aka the `window width`. Here we are concerned with weekly training data so the window width will be in terms of weeks. Since typical training blocks can range anywhere from 8 to 20+ weeks, using a window that's less than 8 weeks will capture effects within the shortest training blocks observed. 

So as a rule of thumb, we will use window widths that are between 0 and 8 weeks, any greater than 8 and we run the risk of 'blurring out' any trends within a short 8 week training cycle.

> For a given week, and window width N, the rolling-mean is the average of the last N weeks


The following graphs are weekly run distance using a rolling-mean with `window width = 3 wks`, across the last ~10 months.

**Vlad Shatrov - Leader up until DNF at ~60km**
<img src="/assets/img/vlad_shatrov_training.png">

Vlad was apparently leading the race until having to dropout due to injury. Even though he didn't finish, his training data contains a wealth of knowledge and detail. Weekly volume was amoung the highest across the top 10 athletes with very few days spent not running. Vlad is a back-to-back winner at Six Foot Track, which is considered to be one of the most competetive trail races in Australia. It conveniently shares some common ground with the UTA 100 course, providing future UTA runners with some local knowledge.

Vlad reached a peak weekly mean distance of approximately 210km before appearing to go into taper mode for Six Foot Track. He raced much more than what is annotated on the graph, some 10kms for instance. These were left off for the sake of clarity. The training blocks are clearly evident: the build up to a bunch of high volume weeks, followed by a taper period before a race, race week, then the gradual return to volume.

Speed sessions were common, as so were weekly long runs. Sometimes long runs contained substantial vertical gain, sometimes very little. The focus of flatter long runs is to build the ability to run continually for a long period of time, whilst long runs with decent vertical gain promote leg and core strength, work on power hiking effeciency, and improve trail skills needed to traverse technical sections fast.

Occasional flat long runs was a trait commonly observed across the top 10 athletes. Interesting.

**Marcin Swierc - 1st**

Marcin does have a Strava profile but appears to not upload frequently, thus rendering a formal analysis of his training impossible. It would have been nice to see considering is the 2018 TDS champion. Some basic research and YouTube-ing reveals he basically wins almost everything he enters. Truly a world class athlete.

<br/>
**Jonathan O'Loughlin - 2nd**
<img src="/assets/img/jonathan_oloughlan_training.png">

Jonathan trained the least amount out of all top 10 runners (assuming his Strava profile is complete). This was quite suprising. How could someone train so little, relatively speaking, yet blaze across the line in 2nd place at one of the most competitive ultra trail races in Australia?

Besides a few indoor bike sessions and swimming there was not much cross training and no racing in the lead up to UTA, in total contrast to all top 10 athletes. Jonathan did however do his long runs on the actual UTA 100 course and was again the only one to do intense step training sessions. UTA 100 is known as having quite a lot of stairs going both up and down. It appears that Jonathan's training was very *specific* to UTA 100. Faster sessions were also seen, often incorporated later on into a run.

He is one of only four runners to have completed *every* UTA. That's every race from 2008 to the present. His knowledge of the course and experience must have played a significant role in efficiently training and competing on the day. All the data points towards Jonathan being an extremely talented runner, who has been running ultras for at least 11 years, and who knows exactly how to approach the course. With the possible addition of a little bit of Lady Luck on the day (as we all hope for), Jonathan's run ranks up there as being one of the best performances seen this year.

<br/>
**Morgan Lindqvist - 3rd**
<img src="/assets/img/morgan_lindqvist_training.png">

Morgan consistently had a weekly mean distance of 100km to 150km, with dips below 100km only due to having a race. This suggests Morgan was able to stay injury free over the last 10 months. The highest weekly mean distance was a little over 150km before tapering for the Mt Solitary 43km race in Arpil. Following Mt Solitary it only took one week of rest before training volume bounced sharply back to pre race values. 

Riding was consistenly seen to be invoked but at very low amounts. 

Morgan competed in UTMB 2018, which is a mountain ultra race that loops around Mt Blanc, starting in Chamonix France. It's a flagship race that attracts the most competitive and talented runners from around the globe. UTMB comes in at 171km with 10,040m of vertical gain with the top runners finishing it under 20hrs. TDS, the race Marcin Swierc won, is one of the sister races for UTMB.

We also see the presence of shorter 10km races.

## Overall observations of individual training approaches

Cross training is also rather common. Half the athletes are using either swimming, riding, or both. Swimming is the most popular amoungst the top 10, potentially used as a form of zero-impact active recovery. In contrast to using riding as cross training, swimming offers the athlete a way to alos build their core stregth, and is vitally important for ultra trail athletes.

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
## Weekly distance
<img src="/assets/img/weekly_distance_rolling_average.png">

Vlad Shatrov, Brendan Davies, and Morgan Lindqvist have the top 3 rolling-mean weekly running distance. Vlad was winning the race until 60km, having to stop due to injury. Morgan came third, and Brendan is the 2018 winner of UTA 100. It seems that consistently high training volume seems to pay off. But with higher training volume comes more risk of injury. over the span of the last 10 months of training data obtained there was little long term injuries sustained by these individuals. they have learnt how to train, address injuries (if any) properly and early before they lead to month-long training hiatuses.

Justin Whitley had the greatest ramp up in running training. He used swimming as a means to balance the loading and it seems to have payed off with a great result, 4th place. Justin entered quite a few races close to the UTA 100 event, performed well across the lot of them, and remained injury free.

The most consistent runner amoungst the top 10 was Matt Crehan; his running weekly rolling-mean line was the flatest out of the lot. Naively one would expect that it was the result of not racing much (having no 'down, recovery weeks'), but he was the 2nd most frequent racer, second to Brendan Davies. Matt was able race and train without little dipping in overall running training. Similarly to Justin Whitley, Matt swam alot. Often 2-4 sessions per week. But this is only one factor contributing to having such a successful training period. One needs to also look into weekly long runs, speed sessions, sequencing of runs withing a week etc. Before narrowing down on a conclusion for now we will just note down that swimming again appears in another successful training block.


Six Foot Track is a popular race amoungst the top 10. 5 of the runners competed this year and placed well. As is mt Solitary ultra. Both these races are in the Blue Mountains which must add to the 'local knowledge' used by the runners to perform well in the UTA 100 event.

## Weekly vertical ascent
<img src="/assets/img/weekly_ascent_rolling_average.png">

Nearing race day, the 3 highest average weekly ascent performers were Mike Carroll, Brendan Davies, and Justin Whitley. Right before UTA 100 they were averaging (over the last 8 weeks), 3-4k of vertical ascent per week. The rest of the top 10 had 1.5-2.5k vertical gain average (over the last 8 weeks).

Again, Justin Whitley and Jonathan O'Loughlin had the steepest increase in weekly average vertical ascent. Based on overall training volume, one may have expected Vlad Shatrov to have a weekly average vertical ascent closer to the 3 highest in the graph above. But this wasn't the case. He did compete in Six Foot Track in March, and we see that there was a drop in average weekly ascent closer to the start of April. But Vlad still maintained a large volume of running so it meant more flat running, on average. Perhaps he was dealing with the injury that would lead to his DNF at UTA 100, but without further information one can only speculate.

## The.Weekly.Long.Run

### Long run distance
<img src="/assets/img/weekly_long_run_distance_rolling_average.png">


From Febuary 2019 to race day we see that, the rolling average for weekly long run distance for 8 out of 10 runners almost converge. In other words, these 8 runners are running roughly the same distance for their long run. Looking at April 2019 we see that most of the graph lines have a value between 30-40km. And because we are using a rolling mean with a window of 8 weeks this means that *at the start of April, most runners for the past 8 weeks have been running their long runs between 30km to 40km*.

The outliers for this period are Jonathan O'Loughlin and Justin Whitley. They dramatically ramp up their long run distances towards UTA 100 as compared to the other top 10.

Looking back at the weekly running distances graph we note something interesting: whilst average weekly distances between runners vary a lot, average weekly long run distances don't. Average long run distance seems to be roughly the same for 8 out of the top ten runners. And so the differences in average weekly distance must be attributed to other types of running sessions, eg. general aerobic, speed/hill/tempo sessions etc.

### Long run vertical ascent
<img src="/assets/img/long_run_vertical_ascent_barplot.png">

The most common amount of vertical ascent for the weekly longest run is 1000-1500m, followed by 0-500. A run must be at least 30km in distance to be considered as a long run.

We see 2 common types of long runs employed:

1. Flat long run with less than 500m vertical ascent
2. Long run with 1000-1500m vertical ascent

### Long run duration
<img src="/assets/img/weekly_long_run_duration_rolling_average.png">

From Feb 2019 to race day the top 10 runners dont seem to run more than 4 hrs for their long runs, on average. At first this comes as a suprise because it's easy to expect that the top 10 must be out there running for longer. That is certainly the case for *weekly* training duration, but their long runs cap at 4hrs during this period. It makes sense when thinking about the overall training load: the risk of overtraining and injury is too great when running for too long, and given that these runners have high training volume it makes sense as they want to be able to run the next day, and the next day, add (almost) infinitum.

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
## Run days
<img src="/assets/img/number_of_days_running_per_week.png">  

The top 10 runners most often run 7 days a week.

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
## Sharper sessions: speed, tempo, hills
<img src="/assets/img/percentage_weeks_having_sessions.png">

Except for one runner, all the top 10 had at least 50% of their training weeks containing either a speed, or tempo, or hill session. Race weeks were also counted as a session (except for uta race week).

Brendan Davies had the most weeks containing at least one session. In addition, he consistently had the highest weekly training volume out of the top 10 runners which marks brendan as a high performance athlete who is able to handle high work loads and frequent competition. Similarly for Vlad Shatrov. ~90% of the Brendan's and Vlad's weeks contained at least one session.

Anthony Boyle is at the other end of the session spectrum. He did little to no sessions and appeared to only race Six Foot Track before UTA. Yet he placed 10th at UTA. Anthony swam the most out of all the top 10, rapidly vamping up swimming even more as UTA got closer. He also frequently had weeks where there was a 35km+ long run and a mid-week double run commute day of 20km+20km. This suggests the importance of strength for both the upper body core and legs. Having a 40km day composed of running to work, working all day, and then running home must surely benefit the runner with being able to handle fatigue, mentally and physically. Knowing that a 20km run lays ahead of you when having a busy day must train the mental strength to 'just get it done'. Ultras have the ability to find any weakness, no matter how small, and exploit it. Often the consequence of said exploitation is to render the runner a nicely minted DNF. Being able to combat that with training days like Anthony's double commutes must surely be advantageous when such issues arise during a race. And you bet ya they arise, for every runner out there.

Speed sessions are known to improve running efficiency, so Anthony may have be making up for any apparent lack of efficiency with shear strength. It's difficult to say for certain because there's only one example of this training style in the top 10. One would need many more runners that invoke this performance/technique before concluding that this is actually the case. For now, we call it a working hypothesis.

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
## Overall insights

1. The top 10 runners are running 6-7 days a week.

2. Nearing UTA, the rolling average (in the last 8 weeks) for long runs is 35-40km. The most common amount of vertical gain for a long run was 1000m to 1500m. The next most common being 0-500m, suggesting that long flat runs were alson utilised. One must keep in mind that since we are using rolling averages of long run distance, we expect that there to be long runs exceeding 40km/ 1500m and some less. For example, one week may contain a 50km long run with lots of vert, then the following run may contain a flatter 30km long run.

3. Speed/tempo/hill work is important and is done at least every other week.

4. Top 10 runners raced frequently across the 10month period of data. Some raced as much as ~10 times.

5. Swimming is commonly employed for active recovery and in building core strength.

6. By the time UTA 100 occurs, most of the top 10 runners are averaging (across the last 8 weeks) a weekly vertical ascent of 1500m to 2250m. This is unexpectedly low but one must remember that we are talking about a *rolling average*, so there will be weeks exceeding and below this amount. 3 of the top 10 runners are averaging a much higher amount, 3000m to 4000m.

7. Jonathan O'Loughlin's performance, given his comparitive low volume training, stands out amoungst the rest. If his Strava data is actually complete ie. every training session was uploaded to Strava, then local knowledge coupled with training specificity (stair workouts, on course long runs), talent, and some luck, seems to be another route towards a great performance. But given that Jonathan has consistently placed highly across the 11 times he's competed, leads one to suspect that it's more talent rather than luck.

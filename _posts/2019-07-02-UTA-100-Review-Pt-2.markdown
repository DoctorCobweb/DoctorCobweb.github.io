title:  "UTA 100 Review Pt 2: Runner Interactions"

In this post we are concerned with visualizing the interactions of runners throughout the course. If a runner passes another runner, or is passed by another runner, then we consider this as an interaction. The runners crossed paths. Each checkpoint tracks the arrival time of any particular runner which can be used to construct a graph of interactions, between any 2 checkpoints.

For example, take two checkpoints, `A` and `B`, where `B` is further from the start line than `A`. For each runner, `i`,  calculate the following two sets:

1. All the runners arriving at `A` before `i` that arrived at `B` after `i`. These are the runners that `i` passed between the two checkpoints.
2. All the runners arriving at `A` after `i` that arrived at `B` before `i`. These are the runners that caught `i` between the two checkpoints.

The union of these two sets of runners constitutes the interactions of runner `i` between `A` and `B`. Do this for every runner who made it to checkpoint `B`, then create a graph where every runner is a node and every interaction between two runners is an edge. Furthermore, the color of a node is derived from the runner's start group, and the node size is proportional to the number of edges it has. In other words, a runner with more interactions has a bigger node.

Now that the basic algorithm has been setup for generating a graph, let's move onto the visualizations.

### Snapshots in time

Graphs were constructed for all adjacent checkpoints and inspected. Here we only include four graphs which represent pairs of checkpoints situated throughout the course:

1. 3km to Narrow Neck
2. Dunphys to Ironpot
3. Fairmont to Queen Victoria Hospital (QVH)
4. Furber Base to the Finish Line

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

We all know the feeling of performing right at the edge of our capabilites: that comfortable but uncomfortable feeling.

It's the thinly drawn line where everything is so finely balanced that even the smallest pertubation threatens to derail the whole experience.

It is the line which divides the `blowing up in flames` performance from the `not pushing yourself hard enough` performance. 

But how are the elite athletes managing to reach the division line, and stay there? Is it talent, hard work, luck, strict training methodology, mental resilience, or a combination of all? What are the most important factors that provide the greatest return in (running effort) investment? How does one train efficiently and effectively?!

By discovering training principles using a data-driven approach, Slow Burn Stats will hopefully help every athlete, no matter what level, reach their full potential.

Along the way there will also be some really interesting stories to tell.

Hope you enjoy the content,

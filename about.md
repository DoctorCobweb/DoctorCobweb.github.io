Slow Burn Stats is a blog that aims to uncover the patterns in athletic performances.

You know that feeling when you're performing right at the edge of your capabilites. It's the comfortable uncomfortable feeling. The thinly drawn line. The line that lies at the intersection of two types of performances: the `blow up in flames` one and the `I didn't push hard enough` one. 

By finding exactly how athletes manage to reach this line yet not cross it, Slow Burn will hopefully help all aspiring, hard working athletes reach their potential.

Along the way there will also be some interesting stories to tell.
